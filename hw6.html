                <h1>Why I do not like maths</h1>
                <p>I don't like it because all of the numbers, the way it makes you figure out everything yourself, and the fact that you don't know where to start or what to do with the numbers and equations given to you. Word problems only make this worse by converting simple equations into complicated sounding questions. And what do you get after decoding that enigma of a question? A math problem that, for whatever reason, is also extremely complicated. And after all that, I don't get any form of praise because apparently "this could've been figured out easily". You don't need people to look down on you when you're doing maths because the subject itself already does. Once you solve a math question that you thought was extremely challenging, it sort of opens up a new method that was there the entire time but you never knew it existed. Furthermore, maths doesn't allow you to use one of my greatest strengths - using paragraphs or good vocabulary to explain yourself. You have to do the majority of your explanations in numbers, which to me makes zero sense(see what i did there). The numbers sort of float around my head, and I have to put them back in their places without any support or guide within the question. I really enjoy writing and communicating through writing, and maths doesn't allow you to do that because it is a very number-dominated subject, which is why I not only dislike it, I also don't care or try during it.</p>
